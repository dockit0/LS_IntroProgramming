x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# my_hash is the new version of hash syntax. 
# my_hash2 is the older version of hash syntax. 

# The first hash that was created used a symbol x as the key. 
# The second hash used the string value of the x variable as the key.
